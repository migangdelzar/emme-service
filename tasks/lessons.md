## 2026-07-31 — GitHub Actions job conditions and secrets

- Failure mode: referencing a job-level `env` value in `jobs.<job>.if` caused
  GitHub Actions to reject the workflow before any job started.
- Detection signal: a workflow run completed with no jobs and no job logs.
- Prevention rule: evaluate optional secrets in an explicit first step, expose
  only a boolean through `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`, and apply `if` to later steps. Never
  expose or print the secret value itself.
